# pokemonautoteambuilder

One day I will write a proper README...

There are three applications in this repository currently:
- The first WPF app I wrote which will only work on desktop Windows
- A Blazor Server App which was the beginnings of a port to Blazor so that it could be accessed online instead and as a web app
- A Blazor WebAssembly App which is the current latest project. I changed from the server app to this one when I realised that I don't want people running heavy genetic algorithms on a server.

This is hopefully going to be a comprehensive Pok√©mon Team Building Web App in the future. For now it's pretty rudimentary but I have some big plans for it.

Thanks to GitHub for hosting this for me. I'll look into hosting it professionally in the future. https://swepps.github.io/pokemonautoteambuilder/
